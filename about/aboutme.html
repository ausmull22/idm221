    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Austin Mullin. I am an undergraduate at Drexel University. I currently studying Entertainment and Arts Management as my Major, while also having a minor in both Business Administration and Animation/VFX. I grew up in Ardmore, PA. Most of the people I hung out with growing up would be my brother and my neighbor. Our favorite pastime would be to make some movies. We eventually discovered Youtube, which we decided to begin uploading our own content onto the platform.

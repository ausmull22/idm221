        <p>My name is Austin Mullin. I am an undergraduate at Drexel University. I currently studying Entertainment and Arts Management as my Major, while also having a minor in both Business Administration and Animation/VFX. I grew up in Ardmore, PA. Most of the people I hung out with growing up would be my brother and my neighbor. Our favorite pastime would be to make some movies. We eventually discovered Youtube, which we decided to begin uploading our own content onto the platform.</p>

        <p>This eventually led to the creation of my own entertainment brand called Mullinmen, which launched in 2012. Since then, Mullinmen has gained 30k views and 150 subscribers. One of its videos was even used as instructional videos for High Schools in the Lower Merion Township. Despite this, I decided to close down the channel in 2018. However, after thinking about projects that help me practice the skills that I have learned in Entertainment and Arts Management, I decided to revive the Mullinmen brand as a website in 2020.</p>

        <p>Some professional experiences I have included working at a real-estate company. The name of the company was Halfpenny Management, and during that time, I helped do technical work, During my time at the company, I helped redesign the website with Wix, making the website easier to navigate for people looking into a renting a place. I also helped with redesigning the company’s logo to make it feel more modern. Aside from digital work, I also helped dispose of confidential information that no longer useful to the company.</p>
